How to Run:

The code for this project is written in Python. 

LINUX:
I have included a linux binary executable of the program. It runs sucessfully on 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 called "main" in the main directory

WINDOWS:
I have also included a windows binary executable of the program. It runs sucessfully on 64-bit Windows 10 called "main.exe" in the main directory

To run the python script directly, a couple of basic dependencies are required:

Python 2.7
Numpy - http://www.numpy.org/
OpenCV - http://docs.opencv.org/

Note: On most systems, these can be installed with PIP quite easily:
pip install numpy
pip install opencv

To run the script, run "python main.py". The script will then display the usage string (input file names, output file names, and harris parameters)

The report is in the file called "cs5404-assignment2-ConnorCoward-report.pdf"

Images for testing are in the "img" folder
